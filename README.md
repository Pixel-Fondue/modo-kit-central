# Modo Kit Central

Modo Kit Central is a community led project to help users find and install kits for Modo.

# Installing the kit
Navigate to the releases tab and download the [latest release](https://github.com/Pixel-Fondue/modo-kit-central/releases/latest).

Once downloaded, drag-and-drop the `modo_kit_central_<version>.lpk` file into Modo to install.

# Current State
The current state of the kit is to show and install (if applicable) all free kits available to the community.
Current installation method requires the kit to be packaged as a LPK.

# Future state
Modo Kit Central will be a hub for all kits, free and paid.
Users will be able to install and update kits directly from the UI.
Non LPK kits that are free and stored on GitHub will be able to be pulled into the MKC plugin.

# Publicly sourced information
After initial release, there will be a method for any user to submit their free or paid (future) kits
to be added to Modo Kit Central.
